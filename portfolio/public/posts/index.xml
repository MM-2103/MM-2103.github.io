<p>Like any other tech student I of course use it to host my school projects, wether I need to collaborate with others or work on my own having everything on Github is quite handy</p>
<h2 id="the-cool-stuff">The cool stuff</h2>
<p>Before I can get into it first some context. I use Linux as my daily operating system, I use it for everything (work, school, gaming, etc..) I am proud to say that I haven&rsquo;t touched Windows in years at this point. The thing with Linux is that you have a lot and I mean a LOT of choices, wether it comes to distrobutions or desktop enviroment/Window managers. So many choices creates a phenomenon called : &ldquo;Distrohopping&rdquo;. Distrohpping is when you just keep changing your system every two days or so (not joking). Naturally having your change your system every couple days is really not handy, becuase you would have to reinstall all your software again and reconfigure everything, it is a real hassle.
But the thing is that you don&rsquo;t have to do all of that and the reason is : dotfiles.</p>
<p>Dotfiles are pretty much all your configurations of the system or a specific software. It is really like magic, it works seamlessley, it like you never formatted your previous system. So I naturally keep all of my dotfiles on Github so that whenever I change systems or want to bring my system with me, all I have to do is clone my dotfiles repo and done.
You can check some of my dotfiles repos, some are puplic and some are private.</p>

            <description>Krashosting What is this Krashosting is a school project that I made with my a group of my classmates at school. The goal of the project was to make a website for a hosting company to sell packages and be able to create/edit/delete packages.
But the but is that we sadly the admin dashboard was kinda done in a hurry so I can only show the frontend.
What was my role The project was worked on by 3 people, including me.</description>

<p>Krashosting is a school project that I made with my a group of my classmates at school.
The goal of the project was to make a website for a hosting company to sell packages and be able to create/edit/delete packages.</p>
<h2 id="but">But</h2>
<p>the but is that we sadly the admin dashboard was kinda done in a hurry so I can only show the frontend.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-role">What was my role</h2>
<p>The project was worked on by 3 people, including me. one person did the frontend, me and my other classmate did the backend.
The backend was made in Go so I am pretty proud of it, this was my first go at Go (haha, get it?) and I think I did a solid job. Go is a really simple language so while it is pretty hard to mess it up I still am proud of what we achieved at the end.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>You can download and run a demo of the website if you would like <a href="https://github.com/MM-2103/Krashosting">https://github.com/MM-2103/Krashosting</a> . I thought about keeping the website online but then I decided that it would be a waste of resources since there really isn&rsquo;t much to see beside the frontend.
Seeing the website in Github would make it so that you would see the backend, which is the thing I worked on with my other classmate.</p>

            <description>Server RAM monitor Why RAM monitor though? well&amp;hellip;. it was suppossed to be a full system monitor but I ran out of time. The whole idea of this project started because I wanted to learn about websockets and a bit of Typescript.
Websockets? Yeah! how else are you going to keep getting update from a server? sending a request every couple seconds or so is really not effecient, so websockets was my go to.</description>

<h2 id="typescript">Typescript</h2>
<p>So I was noticing that the Javascript code that I was writing wasn&rsquo;t exactly&hellip;. clean. Javascript is an amazing language you can do pretty much anything you want with this language, for better or worse, but that is also one of its many flaws, the language is a bit loose with its syntax so you can write some really foul code and it will probably work but it is defenitly not gonna look pretty.
So how does Typescript fix any of this? well it adds types. With types you can say that this variable or function is going to be an integer or string and there is no other way around it, you HAVE to speceify the type. Having to follow these rules is going to beter you mindset and is going to make you change your approach of how you are going to write JS/TS code. Or at least that was how I viewed it.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I just wanted to a programming project that involved Linux and this was the most obvious choice. The project is a websokcet server that keep sending info about the system to a variable and that variable is what helps drawing the charts, thank to chart.js</p>
