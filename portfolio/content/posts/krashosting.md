# Krashosting


## What is this

Krashosting is a school project that I made with my a group of my classmates at school.
The goal of the project was to make a website for a hosting company to sell packages and be able to create/edit/delete packages.

## But

the but is that we sadly the admin dashboard was kinda done in a hurry so I can only show the frontend.

## What was my role

The project was worked on by 3 people, including me. one person did the frontend, me and my other classmate did the backend.
The backend was made in Go so I am pretty proud of it, this was my first go at Go (haha, get it?) and I think I did a solid job. Go is a really simple language so while it is pretty hard to mess it up I still am proud of what we achieved at the end.

## Demo

You can download and run a demo of the website if you would like https://github.com/MM-2103/Krashosting . I thought about keeping the website online but then I decided that it would be a waste of resources since there really isn't much to see beside the frontend.
Seeing the website in Github would make it so that you would see the backend, which is the thing I worked on with my other classmate.
