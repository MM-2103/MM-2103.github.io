# Server RAM monitor


## Why RAM monitor though?

well.... it was suppossed to be a full system monitor but I ran out of time. The whole idea of this project started because I wanted to learn about websockets and a bit of Typescript.

## Websockets?

Yeah! how else are you going to keep getting update from a server? sending a request every couple seconds or so is really not effecient, so websockets was my go to.

## Typescript

So I was noticing that the Javascript code that I was writing wasn't exactly.... clean. Javascript is an amazing language you can do pretty much anything you want with this language, for better or worse, but that is also one of its many flaws, the language is a bit loose with its syntax so you can write some really foul code and it will probably work but it is defenitly not gonna look pretty.
So how does Typescript fix any of this? well it adds types. With types you can say that this variable or function is going to be an integer or string and there is no other way around it, you HAVE to speceify the type. Having to follow these rules is going to beter you mindset and is going to make you change your approach of how you are going to write JS/TS code. Or at least that was how I viewed it.

## Linux

I just wanted to a programming project that involved Linux and this was the most obvious choice. The project is a websokcet server that keep sending info about the system to a variable and that variable is what helps drawing the charts, thank to chart.js
