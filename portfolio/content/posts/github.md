# What do I use my Github for?


## Boring stuff out of the way

Like any other tech student I of course use it to host my school projects, wether I need to collaborate with others or work on my own having everything on Github is quite handy

## The cool stuff

Before I can get into it first some context. I use Linux as my daily operating system, I use it for everything (work, school, gaming, etc..) I am proud to say that I haven't touched Windows in years at this point. The thing with Linux is that you have a lot and I mean a LOT of choices, wether it comes to distrobutions or desktop enviroment/Window managers. So many choices creates a phenomenon called : "Distrohopping". Distrohpping is when you just keep changing your system every two days or so (not joking). Naturally having your change your system every couple days is really not handy, becuase you would have to reinstall all your software again and reconfigure everything, it is a real hassle.
But the thing is that you don't have to do all of that and the reason is : dotfiles.

Dotfiles are pretty much all your configurations of the system or a specific software. It is really like magic, it works seamlessley, it like you never formatted your previous system. So I naturally keep all of my dotfiles on Github so that whenever I change systems or want to bring my system with me, all I have to do is clone my dotfiles repo and done.
You can check some of my dotfiles repos, some are puplic and some are private.
